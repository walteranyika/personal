<h4><font color="#F44336">Signs and symptoms to monitor:</font></h4>

<p><font color="#F44336">1.</font><font color="#304FFE">Bleeding in the back of the throat, causing the victim to vomit blood<p>
<p><font color="#F44336">2. </font>Bleeding from one or both nostrils</font><p>

<h4><font color="#F44336">First Aid Interventions:</font></h4>
<p><font color="#F44336">1.</font> Sit upright and lean forward. By remaining upright, you reduce blood pressure in the veins of your nose. This discourages further bleeding. Sitting forward will help you avoid swallowing blood, which can irritate your stomach. Have the victim spit out blood that collects in the back of the throat or mouth.<p>
<p><font color="#F44336">2.</font> Pinch the nose firmly. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for 5 to 10 minutes. Pinching sends pressure to the bleeding point on the nasal septum and often stops the flow of blood.<p>
<p><font color="#F44336">3.</font> To prevent re-bleeding, don't pick or blow your nose and don't bend down for several hours after the bleeding episode. During this time remember to keep your head higher than the level of your heart.<p>
